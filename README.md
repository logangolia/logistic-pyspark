# logistic-pyspark

Implemented a regularized, logistic regression to classify text documents. The implementation was done in Python, on top of Spark. To handle the large data set, we used Amazon AWS.
Performed three subtasks: (1) data preparation, (2) learning (which was done via gradient descent) and (3) evaluation of the learned model.
